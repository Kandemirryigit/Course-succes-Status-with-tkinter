-Final program looks like this
<hr/>

<h1>How Works?</h1>

-first exam is %30 of the entire exam<br/>
-Second exam is %70 of the entire exam<br/>
-third exam is %70 of the entire exam<br/>
-First exam note is required.<br/>
-Second exam note is optional<br/>
-Third exam note is optional<br/>
-"I took third exam" button means I was unsuccesful at first two exam and I wanted to take third exam. (in turkey so many university gives this change to students.I don't have any idea about other countries.)<br/>
<br/>
-You must write second or third exam note.You can write both of them too but if you click "I took third exam" button the program is automaticly going to ignore your second note.But if you don't click that button then you are required to write your second exam note.And if you don't click that button you shouldn't write your third exam note because if you don't click it means you don't have third exam note.But if you write something mistakenly the program is gonna ignore that<br/>
